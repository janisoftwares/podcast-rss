description: A compilation of my research work based on books, workshops attended, interviews taken with my resources in Australia as well as India & my own practical experience of implementing GST since its inception in my own company Jani Plastics (www.janiplastics.com). A truly joint effort of Anup Jani (CEO www.janiplastics.co.in, Mumbai) & my friend who is financial professional in Sydney, Australia, that explores GST System of Australia & India to come up with business related artifacts useful to the community as well as two great nations. More the people get acquainted, more successful the Govt. becomes in bringing about GST to the economy of the nation for the greater good.
